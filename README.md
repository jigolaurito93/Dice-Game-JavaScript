# Dice-Game-JavaScript

This is a Dice game that I created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript
  - Structured the HTML with a div container with an h1 element
  - 2 divs with class called dice for players 1 and 2
  - To get the random number, I used a Math.random method and multiplied it by 6 to get the numbers from the dice. Then I added + 1 so I could get the range from 1-6
  - Used a querySelector to target images 1 and 2, manipulated the attribute value by using setAttribute that contains 2 arguments, the name of the attribute and the attribute value
  - Generated a for loop to manipulate innerHTML text of h1 to declare the winner
